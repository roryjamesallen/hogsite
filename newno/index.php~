    <h1>Newno</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    This is a custom ruleset for the popular card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)">UNO</a> that has been cobbled together over many years by a group of friends from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macclesfield">Macclesfield, England.</a>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    The basic gameplay is the same as the standard game, so read those rules if you aren't already familiar. This ruleset is comprehensive so don't expect for whatever house rules you have for the standard game to integrate neatly - they probably won't.
    <h3>Dealing</h3>
    Deal 7 cards to each player, placing them face down on the table. Once you've dealt them, place the remaining deck in the middle of the table, also face down.
    <h3>Starting to Play</h3>
    <strong>The first player to play plays first.</strong><br>
    Any player may start the game once all the cards have been dealt and the deck has been placed in the middle. The starting player may play any card from their deck by placing it face up next to (not on) the deck, creating the <i>discard pile</i>.
    <strong>The second player to play goes second.</strong><br>
    Whichever player (to either the direct left or direct right of the starting player) is quick enough to go second, may play any legal card from their hand, also placing it face up on the discard pile. After the second player has played, the direction is set.
  <h3>Continuing to Play</h3>
  After the first two players have played, each player in turn (in the direction set by the first two players' order) play one card from their deck. Special cards may change the direction - see below for all of the special cards and their eccentricities.
  <h2>Special Rules</h2>
  <h3>The Jump In Rule</h3>
  This is the biggest change to the original UNO rules, and is the one that makes Newno so fun:
  <strong>If you have the same colour AND number, you can play it <i>even when it isn't your turn.</i></strong><br>
  <ul>
    <li>You can only jump in if you have the same colour AND number (or special card)</li>
    <li>Play continues from the player who jumped in</li>
    <li>Play continues in the same direction as it was going before</li>
    <li>You can jump in with special cards too, see the individual rules below</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Reverse</h4>
  Jumping in with a reverse card cancels the original reverse (as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk1lU3nJsZg">two reverse</a> cards = no reverse), and play continues from the player who jumped in. For example:
  <ul>
    <li>6 people are playing: A, B, C, D, E, and F and the play direction is clockwise (A, B, C etc)</li>
    <li>C plays a reverse card</li>
    <li>E jumps in with a reverse card of the same colour</li>
    <li>Play resumes in the original direction, clockwise, with F playing next</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Skip</h4>
  Jumping in with a skip will add one to the number of people to be skipped, so if you are jumping in on one skip, two people after you will be skipped. For example:
  <ul>
    <li>6 people are playing: A, B, C, D, E, and F</li>
    <li>A plays a skip card</li>
    <li>C jumps in with a skip card of the same colour</li>
    <li>D and E are <i>both</i> skipped, and play resumes with F playing next</li>
  </ul>
  Skips can stack, but the number of skip jump ins in a row is limited by the number of players:<br>
  <strong>You cannot jump in with a skip if you would have had your go skipped by a previously played skip card, even if the previously played skip was a jump in.</strong>
  <h4>Wild</h4>
  For normal wild cards, the player who jumped in can choose the new colour instead of the original player, however you cannot jump in on a wild card if the first player has already called the new colour.
  <h4>Wild Draw 4</h4>
  The new player picks the colour in the same way as for a normal Wild card, however the number adds, so for the first jump in the number would increase from draw 4 to draw 8.
  <h4>+2</h4>
  The number of cards the next player along without a +2 to play must draw adds up normally, when jumping in play will just continue from the player who jumped.
