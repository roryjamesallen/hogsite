# Custom Repository & Domain
1. Create your repository on GitHub, ideally with the same name as you want the URL to be, plus 'site' (e.g. stevesite if you want steve.hogwild.uk).
1. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) to your local machine (e.g. `git clone git@github.com:steve/stevesite.git`). If you want to test it locally then clone it into wherever you store that stuff e.g. `var/www/html/stevesite` for Linux or your XAMPP `htdocs/stevesite` directory if using that or a similar program/stack. Then you should be able to test it by going to `localhost/stevesite` as long as you have an `index.php` file in the root directory.
1. [Generate an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on your local machine and give Rory the public key, along with the clone URL for your repository and what domain you want (e.g. 'please can I have steve.hogwild.uk, here is my repository URL and here is my public SSH key').
1. Run `git remote set-url --add --push origin ssh://wildhog@hogwild.uk:9284/home/wildhog/repository` to add the live site as a remote to be pushed to as well as GitHub (when you run `git push` you'll now update both GitHub *and* the live site). Replace `repository` in that command with the actual name of your repository.
1. Now edit your site and then commit the changes, and run `git push` to update your repository on GitHub and your live site.
