	<h1>The Hickey Bill Shooting</h1>
	<h2>By The Wild Hogs</h2>
	<h3>Verse 1</h3>
	<span class="chords">           C                 F</span>
	Wearing a bright orange jumpsuit
        <span class="chords">      C                     F</span>
	<a href="https://wiki.hogwild.uk?page=hickey-bill">Hickey Bill</a> went down to the <a href="https://wiki.hogwild.uk?page=annual-turkey-shoot">Annual Turkey Shoot</a>
	<span class="chords">C                      F</span>
	With far too fair a heart
	<span class="chords">Em       Am          G</span>
	To see what was waiting in the dark.... he told ol <a href="https://wiki.hogwild.uk?page=sheriff-stevens">Stevens</a>:
	<h3>Verse 2</h3>
	<span class="chords">C                  F              C                   F</span>
	The barrel of a browning, not too unlikely a thing to see
	<span class="chords">C             F             Em      Am       G</span>
	That is as long as it's not aimin' over me
	<h3>Chorus</h3>
        <span class="chords">          C7</span>
	Oh Hickey Bill
        <span class="chords">           Am</span>
	Don't you wonder
	<span class="chords">B7                     Em</span>
	If you had just have stayed at home
	<span class="chords">F                   G                                C</span>
	Your arm could be flexin instead of cut... to the bone
	<h3>Verse 3</h3>
	<span class="chords">C                F</span>
	The eldest gentleman
	<span class="chords">C                    F</span>
	To re-side in this town
	<span class="chords">C                F                 Em          Am       G</span>
	Would know far better than to just wave his heater around... so says <a href="https://wiki.hogwild.uk?page=deputy-daniels">Daniels</a>
	<h3>Verse 4</h3>
	<span class="chords">C                  F</span>
	So Bill thinks to himself
        <span class="chords">               C                      F</span>
	I guess the depu-ty and sheriff are bought, and although i ought to
	<span class="chords">C                         F</span>
	Take this into my own hands
	<span class="chords">Em   Am      G               C</span>
	I am not a re-venge seeking man
